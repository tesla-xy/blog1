100/ Chunk loading errors may arise from network connectivity issues or new deployments that render previous, hashed JS chunk URLs obsolete. Nuxt includes native support for addressing these errors by executing a hard reload when a chunk fails to load during route navigation. To modify this default behavior, set experimental.emitRouteChunkError to false for complete disablement or to manual if you prefer to manage these errors independently.
